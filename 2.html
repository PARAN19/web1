<p style="margin-top:45px;"><h2><strong>Night on a <u>Spooky Planet</u>_2022 October 30</strong></h2>
: What spooky planet is this? Planet Earth of course, on a dark and stormy night in 2013 at Hverier, a geothermally active area along the volcamic landscape in northeastern Ieceland. Triggered by solar activity, geomagnetic storms produced the auroral display in the starry night sky. The ghostly towers of steam and gas are venting fro fumaroles and danced against the eerie greenish light. For now, auroral apparitions are increasing as our Sun approaches a maximum in its 11 year solar activitt cycle. And pretty soon, ghostly shapes may dance in your neighborhood too.</p>

: What are those red clouds surrounding the Andromeda galaxy? This galaxy, M31, is often imaged by planet Earth-based astronomers. As the nearest large spiral galaxy, it is a familiar sight with dark dust lanes, bright yellowish core, and spiral arms traced by clouds of bright blue stars. A mosaic of well-exposed broad and narrow-band image data, this deep portrait of our neighboring island universe offers strikingly unfamiliar features though, faint reddish clouds of glowing ionized hydrogen gas in the same wide field of view. Most of the ionized hydrogen clouds surely lie in the foreground of the scene, well within our <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/jpl/charting-the-milky-way-from-the-inside-out" target="_blank" title="Charting the Milky Way From the Inside Out">Milky Way Galaxy</a>. They are likely associated with the pervasive, dusty interstellar cirrus clouds scattered hundreds of light-years above our own galactic plane. Some of the clouds, however, occur right in the Andromeda galaxy itself, and some in M110, the small galaxy just below.</p>
